                Game Day Grill is a restaurant that was crafted by a family of hard workers, sports watchers, and
                cookout lovers. Our goal is to serve this country with burgers, fries, and those sweet home runs. And
                while we keep that good Game Day taste in mouths across the tri-state, Game Day Grill has a humble,
                country-folk beginning.

                Richard Harley was a fine father and an even finer football coach at his local school district. Every
                evening he would teach his kids the skills of grilling, all while cheering on their favorite teams, of
                course. Sadly, at the age of 58 he died of a heart attack. Even though he may be resting in peace, his
                dream of grilling burgers and watching the big game still lives on through his family.

                Game Day Grill was opened in 2023 by his son, Tim Harley, to commemorate him. Originally staffed with
                brothers, sisters, daughters, cousins, and parents, his recipes, techniques, and the sounds of sports in
                the background, quickly grew famous, becoming what it is today.

                And though our hardwork pushed us to where we are currently, without the support of our customers, we
                would not be where we are. We thank you for your support and hope you enjoy your meal. May your favorite
                teams win!
